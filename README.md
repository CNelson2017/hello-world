Technical Skills Test
Good Evening! My name is Cynthia Nelson and I am a passionate student advocate that has helped shaped the lives of thousands of students over my vast nine-year career in higher education.  I look forward to the opportunity to take that passion and apply it on a different level and continue to make a difference to those who seek to make a difference themselves.
